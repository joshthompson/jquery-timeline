# jQuery Timeline

jQuery Timeline is a jQuery extension that allows you to easily format a selection of elements into a vertical timeline like layout.

I originally created it for use on my personal website and you can view a working example here: http://www.joshthompson.co.uk/en/music

I plan to add functionality for the following features:

* To make it easy to add more elements to the top and bottom of the timeline
* Make it so you can give an ajax URL to load more data to the bottom for 'infinite scroll'
* Make it so you can use some preset or custom animations of the items when they load

And some general improvements

* Make it so the style sheet isn't just formatted as LESS (because not everyone uses LESS)
* Make it so you can have the items preformatted in as children of the original timeline so you don't have to pass them as an argument
* Documentation!

I'll probably add more things to this list when I think of them or if anyone suggests anything I think would be a good addition.
